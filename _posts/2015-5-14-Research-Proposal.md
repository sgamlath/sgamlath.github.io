Last week I successfully defended my research proposal which is mandatory for fulfillment of my degree. It's titled "Automated user profiling".

The purpose of my research is to Answer the question that, is it possible to automate the user profiling from publicly available data in social network sites ? Nowadays there are vastly available personal data out there thanks to social networks. So it should be easier than ever to do people profiling. But when it have to be done manually it's kind of difficult since it's tedious repetitive and boring because data is scattered all over the web. So I'm trying to give a solution for this question with text mining and natural language processing approach.

User profiling is not a novel idea. Many people have done it in varying contexts throughout the past. Also there are many benefits of this user profiling. There presents good algorithms for text mining and semantic analysis in the present days. So my methodology is new. Also there are ongoing researches in these contexts too. I'm hoping to provide updates on this research as it progresses on. Stay tuned.
