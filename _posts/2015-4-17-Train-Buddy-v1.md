title: Train Buddy v1
---

After few months of beta testing, today I have released the Train Buddy app to public. Train Buddy is a android app for getting the train schedule of Srilankan trains and view the current status (location and speed) of the train. You can learn more from the Google play [app description](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kasungamlath.trainbuddy).

If you are interested in testing the future versions of app please join [this community page](http://goo.gl/VX6BLe). Members of this community will always get the latest functions first.
