Be honest</br>
be true</br>
they say</br>
but do</br>

lying is bad</br>
they say</br>
but why</br>
they always</br>

honest is best</br>
honesty brings peace</br>
so they say</br>
then why war?</br>

honesty is pure</br>
Honesty is clear</br>
honesty is just</br>
honesty is must</br>

jesus never lied</br>
buddha never lied</br>
allah never lied</br>
so why you?</br>

who cut this tree</br>
I do</br>
good son</br>
appreciate your honesty</br>

why hide</br>
why conceal</br>
why fake</br>
what's the point</br>

you may success</br>
lying everyone</br>
but deep inside</br>
you'll always know</br>

be honest</br>
be good</br>
be true</br>
you'll do</br>
