Be honest
be true
they say
but do

lying is bad
they say
but why
they always

honest is best
honesty brings peace
so they say
then why war?

honesty is pure
Honesty is clear
honesty is just
honesty is must

jesus never lied
buddha never lied
allah never lied
so why you?

who cut this tree
I do
good son
appreciate your honesty

why hide
why conceal
why fake
what's the point

you may success
lying everyone
but deep inside
you'll always know

be honest
be good
be true
you'll do
