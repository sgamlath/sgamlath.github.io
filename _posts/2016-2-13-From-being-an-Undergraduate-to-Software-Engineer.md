title: From being an Undergraduate to Software Engineer.
---

I completed the final exams of my B.Sc degree in last month(2016 Jan) and was lucky enough to start working as a Software Engineer from the begining of this month(2016 Feb).

The new working place (Millennium IT's campus) has a nice setup (see [here](http://www.millenniumit.com/millenniumit-malabe-campus)) and from my limited experience is full of nice people. So far the only thing I missed from undergraduate life is skipping lectures and the chats we had while having tea with friend who aren't here at Millenium IT.
