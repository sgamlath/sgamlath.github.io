After playing with heroku for few weeks while wrestling with my fb app for research, I built a web app I always wanted. It was easier than I thought. All I had to do was editing few files in few different projects and firing up a heroku app. So now I got my own web app to download videos from various different sites. There are few bugs to iron out. But the app seems stable enough to use.
