title: HNYC v0.3.
---

Today I came upon a android application with material design to read xkcd comics which is still in alpha state. Interesting point is that it's been released just yesterday and had more that 100 installs. And here I am with trainbuddy app (which is obviously much nicer and more useful :)) which released for 2 months by now and with the same number of installations. But to be fair xkcd has much biger audience (7 billion +) than mine (20 million) since it's a local app. So the ratio of audience is 350:1. 
In light of these new findings I thought of giving a try with a bigger audience with my already released (because of a matter of CV), but yet only known to me (because of 0 marketing) HNYC app. So I updated the store listing and now waiting until the updates were published o start marketing. Who knows may be I'll ride a wave end up in front page of HN. :)
About the app, It has few nice features like pull to refresh, swipe to change the view, (kind of) infinite scroll, Autohiding action bar. Sexy material design. And this is only the begining. You can read more from google play listing.

Get the app from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kasungamlath.hackernews" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.
