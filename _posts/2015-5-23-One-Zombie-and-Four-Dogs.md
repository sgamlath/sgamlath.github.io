title: One Zombie and Four dogs.
---


  Last week I started running in the morning. To be exact the date is 19 May 2015. This is the first time I ran after school times. Well except for  occasionally running to catch the train. I was thinking about running for a while now. As a computer guy I sit in front of the computer most of time in the day. And  my body begins to show signs of that.

  I think the most probable event that triggered running is release of the game [Zombies, Run](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sixtostart.zombiesrunclient) as a freemium app. I downloaded the game plus some music tracks, dusted my old track bottom and canvas shoes and get ready for running in the following morning. I got up at 4 O'clock in the morning with some difficulty and went for the run. It took me around 40 minutes to cover about 5 km distance. And I met one zombie and four dogs while running. Dogs were real.

  Truth to be told it's much about walking than running. Because of dogs(Escaping dogs 101 is Not running) and my (lack of) fitness level. Unfortunately the game had crashed at a middle of the run. (And it kept crashing all the times later). But fortunately big brother Google was looking over me and according to Google fit I only ran 15 minutes of that 40 minutes.
  
  So today is the third day I ran. I just returned from a shower after finishing the run. Have to say It's already feeling good (Except for sour legs). Kind of a kick start for the day.
