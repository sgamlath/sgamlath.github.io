title: Train Buddy 100 installs.
---

After 2 whole months Train Buddy now have 100 total installs. I know it's not much. But it's just another app in train schedule category but with sexy design (atleast I think so). Train Buddy never went viral. just few installs per day. But the growth was steady. The most used app in this category has atleast 100,000 installations. But it's backed by ICTA and kind of the "official" app. 2nd most popular app has atleast 10,000 intallations. So only 16 more years to catchup with that in this rate of installations.

Most important thing is now the app has completed the goal for it's 2nd iteration. Which will enable viewing the stasus of trains when you are "not onboard". With the vacation comming up in next month I think this could be completed before the end of this july. As usual beta testers will get the new version first. So if you are not joined yet join [this community](https://plus.google.com/communities/111728508620143036732) and be ready to have the train stasus at your fingertips anytime you want.
